## Why are these files here?
We strive to provide the most transparent and easy access to software that Google cannot provide in the Google Play Store app store. The Android Market (aka Google Play Store) is an application store that has grown at the expense of independent individual developers, and currently represents a powerful monopoly controlled by Google. It sets out restrictive rules and requirements for both new and existing developers. At the same time, I completely ignore feedback and do not provide support at the proper level. One example of such rules is the requirement of the Google Play Store to find 20 testers before allowing the publication of an application, who are required to test your application without interruption for 14 days. We believe that such actions are a direct threat to the principles of freedom and creativity for individual developers, enthusiasts and small teams. Google has long retreated from any principles, both moral and self-created. Their slogan "Don't be evil" no longer has anything to do with their actions and reality.
